# The Speed of Trust: A Comprehensive Framework

## 1. The Economics of Trust
The central premise is that trust is a hard economic driver, not a soft social virtue. It acts as a multiplier on performance.

### The Trust Formula
Traditional business thinking:
Strategy x Execution = Results

Covey's Trust Formula:
(Strategy x Execution) x Trust = Net Results

### The Trust Tax vs. The Trust Dividend
*   **The Trust Tax (Low Trust):** Speed goes DOWN, Cost goes UP.
    *   Manifests as: Redundancy, bureaucracy, politics, disengagement, and excessive documentation.
*   **The Trust Dividend (High Trust):** Speed goes UP, Cost goes DOWN.
    *   Manifests as: Fast communication, seamless collaboration, innovation, and engagement.

## 2. The First Wave: Self Trust (The 4 Cores of Credibility)
Self Trust is the foundation. You cannot lead others until you trust yourself. It consists of 4 Cores.

### Core 1: Integrity (Character)
*   **Definition:** Congruence. Walking your talk. It is the courage to act in accordance with your values.
*   **Key Practice:** Make and keep commitments to yourself.

### Core 2: Intent (Character)
*   **Definition:** Motive and agenda. Trust grows when people believe you seek mutual benefit.
