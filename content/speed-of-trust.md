# The Speed of Trust: A Comprehensive Framework

## 1. The Economics of Trust
The central premise is that trust is a hard economic driver, not a soft social virtue. It acts as a multiplier on performance.

### The Trust Formula
Traditional business thinking:
Strategy x Execution = Results

Covey's Trust Formula:
(Strategy x Execution) x Trust = Net Results

### The Trust Tax vs. The Trust Dividend
*   **The Trust Tax (Low Trust):** Speed goes DOWN, Cost goes UP.
    *   Manifests as: Redundancy, bureaucracy, politics, disengagement, and excessive documentation.
*   **The Trust Dividend (High Trust):** Speed goes UP, Cost goes DOWN.
    *   Manifests as: Fast communication, seamless collaboration, innovation, and engagement.

## 2. The First Wave: Self Trust (The 4 Cores of Credibility)
Self Trust is the foundation. You cannot lead others until you trust yourself. It consists of 4 Cores.

### Core 1: Integrity (Character)
*   **Definition:** Congruence. Walking your talk. It is the courage to act in accordance with your values.
*   **Key Practice:** Make and keep commitments to yourself.

### Core 2: Intent (Character)
*   **Definition:** Motive and agenda. Trust grows when people believe you seek mutual benefit.
*   **The Trust Filter:** We judge ourselves by our intent; others judge us by our behavior.
*   **Key Practice:** Declare your intent. Explicitly state you want a win-win outcome.

### Core 3: Capabilities (Competence)
*   **Definition:** The talents, skills, knowledge, and style used to produce results.
*   **Why it matters:** An honest person with bad skills still cannot be trusted to do the job.
*   **Key Practice:** Run with your strengths and keep yourself relevant (continuous learning).

### Core 4: Results (Competence)
*   **Definition:** Your track record. Past performance is the best predictor of future behavior.
*   **Key Practice:** Finish strong. Take responsibility for results, not just activity.

## 3. The Second Wave: Relationship Trust (The 13 Behaviors)
Relationship trust is built through behavior. For every behavior, there is a "Counterfeit"—a fake version that destroys trust.

### 1. Talk Straight
*   **Action:** Be honest. Tell the truth. Use simple language.
*   **Counterfeit:** Spinning, positioning, withholding info, or using "corporate speak" to hide the truth.

### 2. Demonstrate Respect
*   **Action:** Genuinely care for others. Respect everyone, not just those with power.
*   **Counterfeit:** Faking respect, or showing respect only to those who can do something for you.

### 3. Create Transparency
*   **Action:** Be open and authentic. Err on the side of disclosure.
*   **Counterfeit:** Having hidden agendas. Withholding information.

### 4. Right Wrongs
*   **Action:** Apologize quickly. Make restitution.
*   **Counterfeit:** Covering up mistakes. Letting pride prevent an apology.

### 5. Show Loyalty
*   **Action:** Give credit to others. Speak about people as if they were present.
*   **Counterfeit:** Bad-mouthing others behind their backs. Taking credit for others' work.

### 6. Deliver Results
*   **Action:** Establish a track record of getting the right things done.
*   **Counterfeit:** Overpromising and underdelivering. Making excuses.

### 7. Get Better
*   **Action:** Continuously improve. Seek feedback.
*   **Counterfeit:** Resting on past laurels. Resisting feedback.

### 8. Confront Reality
*   **Action:** Address the tough issues directly. Tackle the "elephant in the room."
*   **Counterfeit:** Ignoring problems hoping they will disappear. Busywork to avoid hard truths.

### 9. Clarify Expectations
*   **Action:** Disclose and reveal expectations upfront. Ensure shared understanding.
*   **Counterfeit:** Guessing what others want. Leaving expectations vague to avoid commitment.

### 10. Practice Accountability
*   **Action:** Hold yourself and others responsible.
*   **Counterfeit:** Blaming others. Pointing fingers.

### 11. Listen First
*   **Action:** Understand before trying to be understood. Listen with eyes and heart.
*   **Counterfeit:** Listening only to reply. Pretending to listen.

### 12. Keep Commitments
*   **Action:** Do what you say you’re going to do.
*   **Counterfeit:** Making commitments casually. Breaking them without renegotiating.

### 13. Extend Trust
*   **Action:** Demonstrate a propensity to trust others.
*   **Counterfeit:** Withholding trust. Micromanaging. Extending "fake trust" (responsibility without authority).

## 4. The Smart Trust Matrix
Trust is a risk management tool. It combines Propensity to Trust (Heart) with Analysis (Head).

### Zone 1: Blind Trust (High Trust / Low Analysis)
*   Result: You are gullible.
*   Outcome: High risk of being burned.

### Zone 2: Smart Trust (High Trust / High Analysis)
*   Result: Judgment.
*   Outcome: High speed, low cost. You trust, but you verify capabilities and define expectations clearly.

### Zone 3: No Trust (Low Trust / Low Analysis)
*   Result: Indecision.
*   Outcome: Stalled progress.

### Zone 4: Distrust (Low Trust / High Analysis)
*   Result: Suspicion.
*   Outcome: Micromanagement, bureaucracy, and high "Trust Tax."
