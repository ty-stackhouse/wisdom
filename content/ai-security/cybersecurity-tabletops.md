# Using Generative AI to Enhance Cybersecurity Tabletop Exercises: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction to Practice and Cybersecurity Tabletops

Practice forms the foundation of skill development across all domains of human activity. In sports, individuals practice specific movements—kicking, riding a bike, or executing jumps—because practice enables learning, improvement, and refinement of abilities. However, the importance of practice extends far beyond individual skill development; practice becomes even more critical when coordinating teams. Team practice enables members to learn how to coordinate with each other, deal with unexpected situations, and ensure preparedness when facing real scenarios.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

In the cybersecurity domain, practice presents unique challenges that distinguish cybersecurity training from other fields. Cybersecurity practice involves thinking through responses to difficult, unknown events and considering all the logistical implications of incident response. Furthermore, cybersecurity incidents typically span beyond individual persons or teams, requiring coordination across diverse organizational functions including legal departments, communications teams, and technical staff.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

**Cybersecurity tabletop exercises** (also called tabletop exercises or TTXs) are structured practice scenarios designed to help organizations prepare for cyber incidents. A cybersecurity tabletop exercise simulates a security incident in a discussion-based format, allowing participants to practice their response procedures and identify gaps in their preparedness.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Current Challenges in Cybersecurity Tabletop Exercises

## Resource Intensity and Cost Barriers

Building cybersecurity tabletop exercises using traditional methods is challenging, time-consuming, and resource-intensive. Organizations often struggle to develop effective practice scenarios internally because personnel frequently have difficulty seeing threats from an outsider's perspective. This internal blind spot makes it difficult for organizations to think through how external attackers might target their systems and infrastructure.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

To address this limitation, many organizations hire external consulting firms to facilitate cybersecurity tabletop exercises. These external facilitators help organizations practice their incident response procedures and provide critical feedback on areas for improvement. However, this approach comes with significant drawbacks: traditional tabletop preparations can take months to complete and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. These resource constraints limit how often organizations can practice, how frequently they can conduct exercises, and how realistic the practice scenarios can be.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## The Need for More Frequent Practice

The high cost and time investment required for traditional tabletop exercises creates a practice deficit in cybersecurity. Organizations cannot practice as frequently as needed to maintain readiness, cannot easily conduct exercises for smaller groups or specific teams, and struggle to create highly realistic scenarios without substantial external investment. This practice gap leaves organizations vulnerable because cybersecurity skills, like all skills, require regular practice to maintain and improve.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Generative AI as a Solution

Generative AI technologies offer transformative potential for cybersecurity tabletop exercises by addressing the key limitations of traditional approaches. The course material explores how generative AI can enable organizations to practice more often, conduct exercises with smaller groups, enhance the realism of scenarios, and gain additional perspectives on potential attack vectors.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

The fundamental goal is to leverage generative AI to practice responding to unfortunate and unexpected attacks on cyber infrastructure in ways that were previously impractical or impossible.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Why Generative AI for Cybersecurity Tabletops

## Narrative Generation Capabilities

Generative AI tools excel at creating unexpected narratives, which represents one of the most important components of effective tabletop exercises. A compelling narrative forms the backbone of any tabletop exercise, as the narrative forces participants to practice their response procedures while encountering situations that develop their skills for handling unexpected events.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

The key question for applying generative AI to cybersecurity tabletops is whether these tools can create narratives that relate to computer systems in ways relevant for cybersecurity exercises. The course demonstrates that generative AI can indeed create computer-relevant scenarios with remarkable fidelity.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Demonstration: Interactive Linux Terminal Simulation

The course material presents a compelling demonstration of generative AI capabilities through a simulated ransomware attack on a Linux computer. Using a simple prompt, the instructor creates an interactive tabletop exercise scenario:[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

**Initial Prompt**: "You will help me perform a cybersecurity tabletop exercise. Act as a computer that has been the victim of a cyber attack. I will type in bash commands, and you will provide the output that the Linux terminal would produce. Tell me the scenario to start the tabletop, and then ask me for the first command".[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

The AI responds by generating a complete scenario: an organization's public-facing web server has been compromised, users cannot access the website and web applications, and important files have been encrypted with a ransom note left by attackers. The AI then asks for the first command, creating an interactive simulation environment.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

When the user enters the `pwd` command (print working directory), the AI responds with realistic Linux terminal output: `/home/username`. The user then enters `ls -alt` to list files, and the AI generates a realistic directory listing. The simulation continues as the user navigates to a web directory (`cd web`), where the AI shows web-related files including a ransom note. When the user uses the `cat` command to display the ransom note, the AI generates a realistic ransom message.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Significance of the Demonstration

This demonstration reveals extraordinary capabilities. The AI is not interacting with an actual Linux computer; instead, the AI is "dreaming up" or simulating a computer that has been the victim of a cyber attack. As the user enters commands, the AI interprets what would happen on that compromised computer and simulates the output those commands would produce.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

This capability represents something that "all the PhDs in the world and all the supercomputing in the world could not have done" before generative AI technology became available: telling a coherent story and then simulating a computer in a convincing way that's woven into the narrative. The simulation maintains internal consistency—the initial scenario mentions a web server, which correlates with the web directory found in the file listing; the scenario mentions encrypted files, which aligns with the ransom note discovered in the web directory.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

When the user runs the `ps` command to list processes, the AI even hallucinates (generates) a realistic process listing that would appear on that Linux computer. All of this simulation capability emerges from a simple prompt, making it remarkably easy to create practice scenarios.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Formal Definitions and Frameworks

## NIST and CISA Definitions

The **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** and the **Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)** provide authoritative guidance on tabletop exercises. While their frameworks are relatively similar, they offer slightly different definitions.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

**NIST Definition** (Publication 800-84): Tabletop exercises are "discussion-based events where personnel with roles and responsibilities in a particular IT plan meet in a classroom setting or in breakout groups to discuss their roles during an emergency and their responses to a particular emergency situation".[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

**CISA Definition**: A tabletop exercise or TTX is "a facilitated discussion of a scripted scenario in an informal, stress-free environment that is based on current applicable policies, plans, and procedures".[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Core Concept: Role-Playing Game

Fundamentally, a tabletop exercise functions as a role-playing game. The term "tabletop exercise" derives from the format of many role-playing games where participants sit at a table while a story or scenario is presented to them. Participants discuss how they might respond to the presented scenario. Unlike fantasy role-playing games involving dungeons and dragons, cybersecurity tabletop exercises focus on realistic cyber incident scenarios.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Key Roles in Tabletop Exercises

## The Facilitator

The **facilitator** arguably represents the most important role in any tabletop exercise. The facilitator's responsibilities include:[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

-   **Introducing the scenario**: Presenting the initial situation to participants[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   **Managing discussion**: Guiding conversation flow and keeping participants on track[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   **Prompting with questions**: Asking key questions to advance the scenario and probe participant thinking[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   **Time management**: Ensuring the exercise meets key objectives within predetermined time limits (typically 2-8 hours)[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   **Preventing deviation**: Gently steering participants away from tangential discussions that don't serve the exercise objectives[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   **Supporting evaluators**: Ensuring decisions and actions are documented for post-exercise analysis[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    

Facilitators also use **injects**—complications or new information introduced during the exercise. Injects can slow progress by introducing unexpected challenges (such as a password being incorrect in the password manager) or accelerate progress if the tabletop is not advancing as quickly as needed.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

One critical facilitator skill is preventing "bikeshedding," where participants get caught up discussing implementation details that are not consequential to the main objectives. The facilitator must recognize these situations and keep the group focused on meaningful objectives.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Players and Participants

**Players** or **participants** (terminology varies by framework) are the people actively engaging in the exercise. While some frameworks distinguish between senior management and individual contributors, the course material treats all active participants under this category.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Data Collectors and Evaluators

**Data collectors** and **evaluators** observe and document how players perform during the exercise. Their documentation becomes essential during the after-action review and other post-scenario events, providing input about how things progressed during the exercise.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Observers

**Observers** watch and learn without typically playing active roles in the game. Observers might be subject matter experts or other personnel who remain in the background. If the facilitator decides to engage observers, they may ask observers questions, prompting them to contribute to the discussion.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Exercise Design Team

The **exercise design team** or **planning team** (terminology varies) develops the tabletop exercise before "game day". This team's responsibilities include:[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

-   Developing the tabletop scenario and materials[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   Handling logistics for the exercise[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   Generating collateral materials to be distributed[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   Coordinating players and stakeholders[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   Managing all other scenario details[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    

This planning role requires significant time and work.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Traditional Planning Timeline

## Time Investment Required

The time required to plan a traditional tabletop exercise can be substantial. Comparing CISA guidance with NIST guidance reveals that planning and executing a comprehensive tabletop exercise could take as much as 5.5 months from initial planning to completion of after-action reports.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

However, the course material anticipates that generative AI will make much of this timeline compressible. Many roles will become simulatable, and scenario planning will become automatable through generative AI assistance.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Detailed CISA Framework Timeline

The CISA framework provides comprehensive guidance for tabletop planning, though the documentation can be extensive and potentially burdensome for organizations seeking rapid exercise development. The planning phases include:[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Acknowledgment of Optimization Opportunities

The course material acknowledges that while this represents the recommended CISA framework, organizations could handle some phases in parallel and optimize for their specific context. The timeline presented represents a high-level, unoptimized version of the guidelines. Even using this framework, organizations could likely find areas to compress the timeline.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

However, the course argues that generative AI can radically compress planning time and assist with ideation in ways traditional methods cannot.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Value Proposition of Tabletop Exercises

## Primary Objective

The primary objective of tabletop exercises is to determine the effectiveness of an organization's response when facing a catastrophe, incident, or event.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Why Exercises Are Essential

Some practitioners who handle incident response daily (dealing with phishing events, stolen devices, compromised accounts) might dismiss tabletop exercises as unnecessary executive theater. These practitioners might believe they have considered all possible scenarios.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

However, there exists an "ocean of things" that can happen in a business that remain unaccounted for in routine incident response. Tabletop exercises expose these gaps so organizations can recognize deficiencies and take corrective action.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Risk Assessment Matrix

Organizations can classify scenarios using a risk matrix with two axes:[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

-   **Y-axis (Impact)**: Ranging from insignificant to catastrophic[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   **X-axis (Likelihood)**: Ranging from rare to almost certainty[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    

Organizations should focus on scenarios in the top-right quadrant (high impact, high likelihood) to reduce both the likelihood of occurrence and the severity if incidents occur. Tabletop exercises help organizations identify scenarios in this critical quadrant that they haven't previously considered.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Example Scenarios

**Google Workspace Attack Example**:  
A staff member arrives at work (or works remotely) and discovers they cannot log in because an attacker has taken over their Google Workspace account. Through some communication channel (phone call or other means), the organization learns of the compromise.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

This scenario prompts critical questions:

-   Does the organization use Google Workspace as an identity provider for other services?[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   Has the organization been clicking "login with Google" across multiple services?[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   If Google Workspace accounts are compromised, are all downstream services also unavailable?[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   Could essential tools like paging systems or chat platforms become inaccessible?[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   If these services use Google Workspace as an identity provider and the identity provider is compromised, could attackers laterally move through other systems?[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    

The tabletop discussion also reveals practical questions:

-   Does anyone know who to call at Google during an incident?[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   Does anyone in the company know who would have that contact information?[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   If that person is on vacation, is there a proxy who also has that information?[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    

These questions emerging from relatively low-effort tabletop discussions can help close gaps that would be highly significant during real incidents.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

**Zero-Day Malware in Data Center**:  
The organization discovers its data center has been compromised with zero-day malware that appears to be sending huge quantities of data to somewhere on the Internet.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

Critical decision points include:

-   Should the organization immediately cut Internet access from the data center or even cut power?[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   If the answer is yes, who is authorized to make that call?[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   Is that authority documented?[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   Should the organization engage with the FBI or other government agencies?[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   Should the organization call a service provider with whom they have a retainer for incident response?[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    

Organizations don't want to discover answers to these questions during the heat of an actual incident. Answers should be ready, well-documented, and understood by all participants who might be engaged in such situations.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

**Friendly Fire - EDR/XDR Vendor Patch**:  
An EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) or XDR (Extended Detection and Response) vendor pushes a patch to software on the organization's Windows machines, and all patched machines begin to blue screen. Initially, it's unclear whether machines are completely bricked (unable to recover) or just experiencing crashes.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

Mitigation strategies might include:

-   Patching only 10% of computers per day over ten days to reach 100% coverage, reducing the risk of organization-wide incidents[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   Versus having automatic updates enabled, which could create a blast radius of 100% of Windows environments[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    

Additional considerations:

-   Was this software included in business continuity planning?[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   Does a plan exist for when this software malfunctions and starts causing system failures?[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    

Worst-case scenario: All Windows machines use BitLocker for encryption, and the problematic patch not only causes blue screens but also corrupts encryption keys. While this scenario involves some hyperbole, it represents the type of thinking worth exploring in tabletop exercises.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Additional Benefits Beyond Gap Identification

**Building Cross-Team Relationships**:  
Tabletop exercises involve cross-team, collaborative activities that build stronger relationships among teams. Exercises help establish expectations during actual events and can establish social norms (such as more direct communication during incidents to enable faster response).[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

**Spotting Technical Gaps**:  
Exercises reveal obvious gaps, such as not knowing who to call when critical decisions (like cutting Internet from a data center) need to be made. These are easy gaps to notice and remediate.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

**Creating Safe Exploration Space**:  
Tabletops provide a safe environment to explore potential scenarios, find gaps, build relationships, develop more effective teams, and iterate on learnings from exercises. Through repeated practice, organizations develop "reasonably well-oiled machines" for investigating incidents, implementing fixes, and restoring operations.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## How Generative AI Enhances Value

Generative AI can help rapidly create and execute tabletop exercises across a spectrum of scales:[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

-   **Large exercises**: Spanning multiple teams, involving senior leadership and C-suite participants[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   **Micro-tabletop exercises**: Single-team or close-knit groups of teams that can build and execute exercises on-the-fly to maintain practice[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    

The course explores methods for achieving this rapid development and execution, enabling teams to mature much more quickly than traditional tabletop approaches allow.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## The Basement Flooding Exercise: A Preview

Before diving into cybersecurity-specific applications, the course presents a non-cybersecurity example to demonstrate what learners will be able to build by course completion.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Sam Hayes' Basement Flooding GPT

Dr. Sam Hayes created a custom GPT (a customized version of ChatGPT) that applies tabletop exercise principles to a scenario many people can relate to: a basement flooding incident. This GPT allows users to practice responding to hard events in a stress-free environment.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## The Scenario Unfolds

When the user clicks "I'd like to begin this tabletop exercise," the **facilitator** (the coaching AI) presents the scenario:[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

**Initial Situation**: It's 7:30 PM on a weeknight, and the user is relaxing at home. Suddenly, the user hears a strange rushing noise followed by water seeping into the edges of the basement. Within minutes, water is pooling rapidly, and the user suspects something major has gone wrong. Stepping into the basement, the user feels water already covering part of the floor and rising fast. A large volume of water is entering the home, likely due to a ruptured water main outside. The source of water inside isn't immediately visible, but it's coming in quickly. The basement lights are still on for now, but the situation is deteriorating.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

The facilitator asks: "What are your first steps? How do you assess and respond to the situation?"[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## User Response and AI Adaptation

The user responds: "I wade into the water and turn the water shutoff valve for the main water line into my home".[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

The AI dynamically responds to this input, describing the outcome:[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

-   Water has risen to mid-shin level and is cold[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   The valve is stiff from lack of use and doesn't turn easily[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   There's uncertainty whether shutting this valve will stop the flow since the issue may be outside[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    

The AI asks: "How do you proceed? Would you force the valve or take another step?"[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

When the user forces the valve, the AI describes the valve creaking and turning, but notes that water continues pouring into the basement at the same rate. This reveals that the user's action, while reasonable, didn't solve the problem.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Escalating Complexity

The user decides to call a plumber. The AI then **impersonates the plumber**, creating dialogue: "Hello, this is Rapid Response Plumbing emergency line. How can I help you? Can you describe the issue? Is water actively flooding your home right now? Do you know where the water might be coming from?"[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

The AI is not just presenting scenarios but actively testing the user's ability to interact with other roles needed to solve the problem.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

When the user explains the situation, the plumber responds: "If your main water shutoff valve didn't stop the water, it sounds like the issue is likely the city's water main outside your home and beyond your shutoff valve. Unfortunately, we can't repair a city water main directly—that's a job for the water utility company".[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Learning Through Practice

This interaction reveals complexity the user hadn't initially considered. The user's initial answer—"call the plumber"—seemed reasonable, but the user hadn't thought about scenarios where the plumber can't fix the problem because it's the city's responsibility.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

This practice experience prompts realizations:

-   Perhaps the user should have a list of important emergency numbers written down for emergencies[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   The list might include the plumber but also the city water utility[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   Similar lists might be needed for electricians and power companies, gas services, etc.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    

The exercise helps users understand not only how to practice response procedures but also what playbooks and resources to prepare in advance—things to have on hand, memorized, or easily accessible.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Pedagogical Value

This exercise demonstrates that many details require practice for unexpected events. While the course focuses on cybersecurity applications, the same skills taught in the course can be applied to other types of events as well.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

The user is encouraged to experience this basement flooding scenario to understand how generative AI can push thinking and reveal preparation gaps.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Generative AI as Facilitator

## Capabilities Demonstrated

The basement flooding example shows that generative AI can act as a facilitator in at least small-scale scenarios. The AI performs key facilitator functions:[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

-   **Describing actions and consequences**: When the user turns off a pipe, the AI might describe the pipe not turning completely, breaking, or other outcomes[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   **Acting on behalf of people not present**: The AI impersonates the plumber when the user makes a phone call, describing what the plumber says, how long until arrival, and recommendations for actions while waiting[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    

## Expanding AI Usage Across Phases

As the course progresses, learners will see how to expand generative AI usage across various roles and phases:[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

This expanded usage enables contraction of traditional timelines, making frequent, high-quality tabletop exercises more accessible.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Prompt Engineering Patterns

## The Flipped Interaction Pattern

## Concept and Purpose

The **flipped interaction pattern** is a powerful prompting technique that allows the large language model (LLM) to drive the conversation by asking questions rather than answering them. In traditional interaction, users ask questions and the LLM provides answers. Flipped interaction reverses this dynamic: the LLM asks questions and the user provides answers.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

This pattern proves incredibly helpful when users don't necessarily know everything needed to achieve a goal, when users want to be tested or quizzed on something, or whenever users don't want to be in the driver's seat but rather want to help provide information without formulating questions or tasks.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Basic Structure

The fundamental structure of the flipped interaction pattern includes:

1.  **Instruction to ask questions**: "Ask me questions about [topic]"[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
2.  **Goal specification**: "until you have enough information to [achieve specific goal]"[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
3.  **Action upon completion**: "When you have enough information, [perform specific action]"[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
4.  **Initial prompt**: "Ask me the first question"[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    

## Example: Fitness Regimen

**Prompt**: "Ask me questions about fitness goals until you have enough information to suggest a strength training regimen for me. When you have enough information, show me the strength training regimen. Ask me the first question".[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

The more context provided about the desired outcome, the better questions the AI can ask. Users can also specify how many questions to ask or how many questions to ask at a time.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

**Why "Ask me the first question" matters**: Ending with this phrase reliably triggers one-question-at-a-time behavior. One-at-a-time questioning is often preferable to receiving all questions at once because the AI can adapt each subsequent question based on the previous answer. If the AI generates four questions simultaneously, it cannot adapt individual questions based on answers because the questions are already formulated.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

**Fitness Example Dialogue**:

_AI_: "Great, let's get started. My first question is: What are your specific fitness goals? Are you looking to build muscle mass, increase strength, endurance performance, or achieve a particular goal?"[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

_User_: "I'm looking to build explosive power and also prevent patellar tendon apathy from doing jumps on a mountain bike"[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

The user doesn't necessarily know what exercises to do, which is why using the flipped interaction pattern allows the AI to ask the questions needed to design an appropriate program.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

_AI_: "Do you have any current or past medical conditions or injuries that may affect your ability to participate? Additionally, if you've been diagnosed with this or you're looking to prevent proactively?"[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

_User_: [Provides medical information][[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

_AI_: "How many days per week can you dedicate? Additionally, do you have any access to a gym or fitness equipment?"[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

_User_: "I can work out five days per week for 30-45 minutes at a time"[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

Finally, the AI generates a complete fitness regimen tailored to the user's answers, including exercises specifically helpful for the stated knee issue (goblet squats, split squats, and other squat variations). The AI has taken into account all earlier answers and the overall context (weight training) to generate a comprehensive, personalized program.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Power of Goal-Driven Questioning

The prompt included "when you have enough information, show me the strength training regimen". This demonstrates another important capability of the flipped interaction pattern: setting a goal for how much questioning should occur.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

Without this pattern, asking questions to an LLM often results in responses like "Well, in order to do this, I need a bunch of additional information" or generic initial plans followed by "but if you provide additional details, I might also be able to...". The flipped interaction pattern eliminates this by instructing the AI to ask questions until it has enough information, then proceed to the goal.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Applications Beyond Fitness

Flipped interaction is useful for:

-   **Quizzing and testing knowledge**: The AI asks questions to test understanding[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   **Playing games**: The AI drives game mechanics through questions[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   **Customer service scenarios**: Collecting information to diagnose problems and automate responses[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   **Any scenario requiring information gathering before action**: The AI asks questions until sufficient information is collected, then takes appropriate action[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    

The pattern is especially powerful when the LLM has been trained on knowledge or patterns that will be useful in creating questions—knowledge the user doesn't possess. For example, the user might not know what questions should be asked for someone with patellar tendon apathy, but the AI has seen patterns in its training data where these conditions were discussed alongside specific exercises and questions. The AI can leverage these patterns to select appropriate questions and design suitable programs.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Applying Flipped Interaction to Cybersecurity Tabletops

## Gaining New Perspectives

One of the fundamental challenges in security is seeing things from different perspectives. Organizations often develop tunnel vision, looking at situations only from their own perspective, which creates gaps in knowledge, capabilities, and incident response abilities.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

The flipped interaction pattern helps address this by allowing generative AI to provide new perspectives. Unlike simply commanding the AI to "generate a scenario that looks like this" (where the user dictates everything), flipped interaction allows the user to provide information through answering questions. This enables the AI to think about what would be an appropriate scenario based on user answers.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Why This Provides Different Perspectives

The flipped interaction approach gives a different perspective than self-designed scenarios. While organizations don't have to use exactly what the AI suggests, the AI provides alternative viewpoints. By running the exercise several times with different answers, the AI adapts its approach each time due to inherent randomness, helping organizations see new ways of preparing tabletop exercises.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Example: Generating Cybersecurity Tabletop with Flipped Interaction

The course provides guidance on using flipped interaction to generate cybersecurity tabletop scenarios. The approach begins with establishing context about effective cybersecurity tabletops.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

**Initial Context Setting**: Start by defining what an effective cybersecurity tabletop looks like. This specification can be adapted based on specific organizational goals. The context should spell out important scenario qualities such as:[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

-   Progressive escalation[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   Cross-impact complexity[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   Time pressures[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   Other qualities important for realistic scenarios[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    

**Flipped Interaction Prompt**: After laying out desired qualities, use this structure:

"Let's go and explore this. But rather than me telling you to generate an entire scenario, what I want you to do is ask me questions one at a time to help me develop an exceptional cybersecurity tabletop. Start by asking me who the tabletop is for".[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

This is the key distinction: instead of telling the AI to generate everything immediately, the prompt instructs the AI to ask questions. As the user provides information, the AI learns more about objectives and can then generate an appropriate tabletop.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

**Why "Ask me questions one at a time" and "Start by asking me who the tabletop is for" matter**: These phrases kick off one-at-a-time questioning mode. Variations include "start," "the first question," or "ask me the first question," but the goal is to engage the AI in one-question-at-a-time interaction.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Dialogue Example: Vanderbilt University Scenario

_AI_: "Who is the cybersecurity tabletop exercise designed for? Could you specify the organization, team, or audience?"[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

_User_: "This is going to be a tabletop for Vanderbilt University"[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

_AI_: "Okay, for Vanderbilt University, could you clarify the primary audience within the organization? For example: IT and security, executive leadership, cross-functional teams, healthcare system teams, research teams"[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

**Critical observation**: Because the user mentioned Vanderbilt University, the AI knows Vanderbilt is connected to Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The AI therefore includes "healthcare system teams" in its question. If the AI had asked ten questions simultaneously at the beginning, it might not have known to include healthcare teams because it wouldn't have known the organization was Vanderbilt.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

This demonstrates the adaptation power of one-at-a-time questioning: The AI adapts subsequent questions based on previous answers.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

_User_: "Pick something creative for me that will test these groups, but is very realistic"[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

**Important principle**: When trying to use flipped interaction to gain new perspectives, don't be too prescriptive. Instead of specifying exactly what to pick, provide parameters, constraints, and goals, then let the AI select something relevant. This approach yields richer perspectives because overly prescriptive instructions limit the richness of AI-generated perspectives.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

_AI_: "Okay. Research espionage and data exfiltration via compromised credentials.

**Scenario**: A prominent research lab at Vanderbilt collaborating with international partners on cutting-edge biomedical research becomes the target of an advanced cyber attack.

**Phase 1**: VUIT receives reports of unusual activity on a faculty member's account with multiple access attempts from overseas locations.

**Phase 2**: Security monitoring tools flag large data transfers from the university's research servers to an unknown external IP.

**Phase 3**: Media leak—Communications is alerted to an anonymous tip sent to a local journalist claiming Vanderbilt's research has been stolen by a foreign entity.

**Phase 4**: OGC realizes that the compromised data includes federally protected information, triggering potential noncompliance with research grant requirements.

**Phase 5**: Academic disruption—The Provost's office is informed that access to key systems supporting ongoing research and coursework has been temporarily disabled to contain the breach".[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

This represents an excellent starting scenario that tests multiple different teams. The scenario tests not only IT but also:[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

-   The Office of General Counsel (OGC) regarding federal research compliance
    
-   Communications regarding media relations and crisis messaging
    
-   The Provost's Office regarding academic and research operations continuity
    
-   Multiple teams on cross-functional coordination
    

The AI explains how the scenario tests each team:

-   **VUIT**: Technical incident response and threat containment
    
-   **OGC**: Navigating legal and compliance implications
    
-   **Communications**: Internal and external crisis messaging challenges
    
-   **Provost's Office**: Ensuring academic and research continuity while balancing faculty and student needs during system outages
    

## The Power of Cross-Functional Scenarios

It would be difficult to find a single individual on campus with knowledge of all these different operations, groups, and their specific considerations to design a scenario that accurately and effectively brings together all these teams and challenges each in unique ways.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

The flipped interaction pattern enables the AI to look at each group, consider the types of challenges that group would need to practice, and weave everything into a cohesive scenario where teams must work together. The scenario forces cross-functional collaboration, supporting incident response not just from technical perspectives but also from legal, communications, and academic operations perspectives.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

This demonstrates the beauty of flipped interaction: If the user is too prescriptive, the result will likely be too technical or too limited in knowledge domains to be truly effective. Alternatively, bringing together a group of people with sufficient collective knowledge to think through such a comprehensive tabletop scenario would require vast time and effort.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

Flipped interaction allows the AI to take more of a front seat in providing perspectives that cross multiple roles without forcing the user to be overly prescriptive. This doesn't eliminate the need for real subject matter experts (who provide higher fidelity), but it enables more frequent practice when gathering all experts together regularly would be impractical.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## The Outline Expansion Pattern

## The Challenge: Token Limits

When working with generative AI systems like ChatGPT, there's a fundamental limitation: output token limits. Typically, the system can generate around 1,000 tokens at a time, which roughly equals one page of text.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

This creates a critical constraint: No matter what you ask, you'll receive approximately one page in response.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

**Implications of the token limit**:

-   Ask about a very specific detail → Get a page of information about that one detail with fine-grained specifics[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    
-   Ask a big question (like "give me a tabletop scenario") → Get a high-level overview in that one page[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    

## Navigating the Token Limit: Think in Outlines

The solution is to navigate by zooming in and out, thinking in terms of outlines. The outline expansion pattern overcomes the one-page limitation to build rich, detailed cybersecurity tabletops spanning much more than a single page.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## The Outline Expansion Process

**Step 1: Generate Initial Outline**  
Prompt ChatGPT to generate an outline for the scenario. This will produce a set of topics, decision points, phases, or steps—essentially a bulleted structure.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

**Step 2: Select a Subtopic to Expand**  
From the initial outline, choose one individual item (one phase, one decision point, one step) and ask ChatGPT to expand it.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

**Example**: If the initial scenario includes three phases, prompt to get the high-level overview, then select one phase and have it expanded with additional detail.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

**Step 3: Iterative Expansion**  
Continue this process, analogous to building a traditional outline:[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

-   Start with top-level points (maybe 10 initial items)
    
-   Take one point and add sub-bullets
    
-   Add sub-bullets to those sub-bullets
    
-   Continue adding layers until sufficient detail is achieved
    

**Step 4: Apply to Scenario Building**  
Take each individual component of the high-level scenario and prompt to expand it in the conversation. Over time, iteratively take the high-level scenario, drill into individual components, and enrich them with additional detail.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

The result: Transform a simple high-level scenario into a comprehensive, detailed exercise resource—like expanding a tree outline until there are actual text paragraphs beneath each section.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Practical Example: Expanding the Vanderbilt Scenario

**Initial Scenario** (first three of five phases):

**Phase 1 - Suspicious Activity Detected**: VUIT receives reports of unusual login activity on a faculty member's account with multiple access attempts from overseas locations.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

**Phase 2 - Data Exfiltration Discovered**: [Content from earlier example][[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

**Phase 3**: [Content from earlier example][[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

These phases provide a starting point, but need enrichment to create a truly useful scenario.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

**Expansion Prompt**:  
"Let's iteratively build out the details for each phase. Let's start with phase one. I'd like an enriched description of the phase. I would like a set of three decisions that the team must take that will push the team".[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

**Adding specific constraints**:  
"Let's assume the faculty member that was compromised is Jules White. Let's assume that the failed logins and transfers were to a small town in Texas rather than another country. However, Dr. White has never had any activity from that region and was logged in from Nashville five minutes before".[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

**Why these constraints matter**: Making the scenario more nuanced increases difficulty. International logins are obviously suspicious, but domestic logins in the same country are less obviously malicious. They might correlate with recent travel, making the situation trickier to assess.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

**Expanded Phase 1 Output**:

"**Phase 1: Suspicious Activity Detected**

VUIT receives an automated alert about multiple failed login attempts on Dr. White's University account. The activity originates from a small town in Texas that has no known connection to Dr. White. Shortly after, logs show a successful login from the same location, despite Dr. White having logged in from his office in Nashville just five minutes prior.

This information triggers VUIT to initiate an investigation, contacting Dr. White to verify his recent login activities. Dr. White denies any connection to Texas and confirms he has not shared his credentials. With the potential risk of unauthorized access escalating, the incident response team convenes to discuss next steps.

**Decisions for the Team**:

**Decision 1 - Immediate Response to Login Anomaly**:  
Should VUIT disable Dr. White's account immediately to prevent further unauthorized access? Or should they instead monitor the activity to gather more data and avoid impacting Dr. White's ongoing projects?

**Decision 2 - Scope of Investigation**:  
Should VUIT notify Dr. White's department and begin a full audit of access logs? Or should the investigation remain narrowly focused on Dr. White?

**Decision 3 - Internal Notification**:  
Should VUIT escalate to the Provost's office and communications? Alternatively, should they keep the response internally?"[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

The AI has incorporated the specific constraints (Texas location, Dr. White as the compromised faculty member, the five-minute timing) while creating realistic scenario details and decision points that will require teams to practice critical thinking.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Further Expansion: Drilling Deeper into Decisions

**Expanding Decision 1**:

**Enhanced Decision 1 Output**:

"**Enhanced Detail for Decision 1 - Immediate Response to Login Anomaly**

VUIT must decide whether to prioritize security or minimize disruption to Dr. White's work. The decision comes with significant trade-offs.

**Option A - Disable the Account Immediately**:  
_Pros_: Halts any further unauthorized access and prevents potential data exfiltration  
_Cons_: Disabling the account will cut off Dr. White's ability to access research servers, email, and teaching platforms. Being a faculty member with ongoing classes, this could prevent Dr. White from grading students' assignments, providing timely feedback, or holding class.

**Option B - Continue Monitoring**:

**Additional Context for the Team**:

**Value of this expansion**: The AI provides rich information, context, and details on what seemed like a simple decision. The expansion includes:[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

-   Pros and cons of each option
    
-   Specific institutional details (D2L as the learning management system at Vanderbilt)
    
-   Impact analysis on Dr. White's ability to perform his duties
    
-   Questions to ask during post-exercise review to identify gaps
    

**Important note on questions**: The "Questions to Push the Team Further" are likely not for use during the tabletop itself, but rather for the post-exercise lessons-learned discussion. These questions help identify gaps in processes, documentation, and decision-making frameworks. For example: "What is the threshold for determining whether continued monitoring outweighs the risk of allowing unauthorized access?" This question helps teams recognize whether they have documented thresholds for such decisions.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

## Continuing Expansion Across the Outline

**Expanding Phase 2**:  
Simply follow up in the conversation: "Phase two"[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

The AI then expands Phase 2 with additional detail about data exfiltration, including:

-   "The scale of the potential breach is escalating" (not just that exfiltration occurred, but that volume is increasing)
    
-   Recognition that "the team faces the reality that sensitive federally funded research data may have been exfiltrated"
    
-   Serious questions about regulatory compliance, intellectual property loss, and potential need to involve law enforcement
    
-   Decisions for the team (containment strategy, notification and escalation, communication plan)
    
-   Questions to push team understanding[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​
    

This builds out another branch of the scenario, continuing the enhancement process.[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

**Jumping to specific decision within a phase**:  
"Let's enhance decision number two"[[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/attachments/120577586/8c4bca13-7619-4e4a-a2a4-e616dcdeb54d/cybersecurity-tabletops.txt)]​

Because this prompt occurs within the Phase 2 conversation, the AI contextually understands this refers to decision two of phase two—no need to specify "
