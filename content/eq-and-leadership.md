### I. Emotional Intelligence (EQ)
**Definition:** The ability to monitor feelings (self and others), differentiate them, and use that info to guide thinking/action.

**The 4-Branch Model:**
*   **Perception & Expression:** Identifying emotions via faces, tone, and body language.
*   **Using Emotion to Facilitate Thinking:** Prioritizing what we attend to based on emotional response.
*   **Emotional Understanding:** Differentiating between complex states and predicting emotional transitions.
*   **Emotional Management:** The most advanced skill; staying open to both pleasant and unpleasant feelings to promote growth.

**Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB):** Voluntary, positive actions by employees outside their job descriptions, which are highly correlated with high EQ.

### II. Building Trusting Relationships
**ABI Model of Trust:** Perception of these three traits leads to trust:
*   **Ability:** Perceived competence and training.
*   **Benevolence:** Perceived concern for the well-being of others.
*   **Integrity:** Consistency between a leader's words and actions.

**Conversational Intelligence:**
*   **Level 1 (Transactional):** Straightforward exchange of information.
*   **Level 2 (Positional):** Influence-driven; one side expects the other to conform.
*   **Level 3 (Transformational):** Co-creative; driven by curiosity and interest, leading to deeper trust.

**Biological Markers:** Trust is linked to Oxytocin (the bonding hormone), while low trust/monitoring environments trigger Cortisol (the stress hormone).

### III. Power and Influence
**5 Bases of Power:**
*   **Legitimate:** Derived from formal titles/roles.
*   **Reward:** Control over tangible (pay) or intangible (gratitude) resources.
*   **Coercive:** Use of threats or manipulation.
*   **Expert:** Derived from unique skills or experience.
*   **Referent:** Derived from being respected and liked.
*   *Note:* Informational Power (access to unique data) was added later as a 6th base.

**Psychological Effects of Power:** Feeling powerful can reduce mirror neuron activity, making it harder to take others' perspectives or read their emotions.

**Psychological Safety:** An environment where individuals feel safe to be their authentic selves and make mistakes without fear of punishment.

### IV. Negotiation and Conflict Management
**3 Goals of Negotiation:** Create value (expand the pie), Claim value (get your share), and Cultivate relationship/reputation.

**Conflict Types:**
*   **Task-based:** Disagreement over the work itself or decisions.
*   **Relationship:** Stemming from personality or communication style clashes.
*   **Values-based:** Stemming from deeply held assumptions or cultural norms.

**Conflict Resolution Model:** Measures behavior along Assertiveness (satisfying own needs) and Cooperativeness (satisfying others' needs):
*   **Avoiding:** Low Assertive, Low Cooperative.
*   **Accommodating:** Low Assertive, High Cooperative.
*   **Competing:** High Assertive, Low Cooperative.
*   **Collaborating:** High Assertive, High Cooperative (seeking win-win).
*   **Compromising:** Moderate on both; finding "good enough" solutions.

### V. Boundary Spanning Leadership
**Definition:** Establishing direction, alignment, and commitment across boundaries to serve a higher vision.

**5 Types of Boundaries:** Horizontal (between functions), Vertical (rank/hierarchy), Stakeholder (external groups), Demographic (gender/generation), and Geographic.

**3 Key Strategies:**
*   **Manage Boundaries:** Strengthen them first to build safety.
*   **Forge Common Ground:** Nurture relationships to build trust.
*   **Discover New Frontiers:** Combine unique capabilities for breakthrough innovation.
