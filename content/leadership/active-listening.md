**Active listening** is a communication method where the listener seeks to understand both the other person's literal words and their underlying meaning by attending to verbal and nonverbal cues. It is distinct from typical listening because the listener **actively engages with the speaker while refraining from evaluating or judging** what is being said.

### **Core Practices of Active Listening**
According to the sources, there are two primary practices required to listen effectively:
*   **Turning off the "internal script":** Most people listen simply to gather enough information to formulate a response, but active listening requires listening without judgment or immediate evaluation.
*   **Listening for more than words:** Listeners should evaluate nonverbal behaviors, such as **body language, tone of voice, and facial expressions**, to understand exactly where the other person is coming from.

### **The Mechanics: Reflecting and Pausing**
The sources suggest specific techniques to improve this skill:
*   **The "Secret Pause":** This is the intentional gap between listening and reacting, which allows a leader to process information patiently rather than jumping to conclusions.
*   **Reflecting Back:** To ensure correct understanding, the listener should integrate what they have learned and share it back to the speaker using phrases like, **"I heard you say XYZ. Have I captured that correctly?"**.
*   **Nonverbal Observations:** A listener can also reflect back observations about nonverbal cues, such as saying, "You used the word happy, but you seem unsure".

### **Leadership and Biological Benefits**
*   **Trust and Connection:** Active listening is a foundational skill for **transformational conversations**, which are co-creative and driven by curiosity. It is often paired with **humble inquiry**—the art of asking questions from a state of total curiosity.
*   **Hormonal Impact:** This level of engagement is associated with **higher levels of oxytocin** (the bonding hormone) and **decreased levels of cortisol** (the stress hormone).
*   **Reducing Power Distance:** By demonstrating deep respect for the other person's perspective, active listening can **reduce the power distance** between individuals, creating a more even footing in the relationship.
*   **Dehumanization Prevention:** It serves as a tool to see the humanity in others, ensuring team members are treated as people with unique desires and values rather than just "tools" for achieving organizational goals.

### **Application in Boundary Spanning**
While active listening is an interpersonal skill, it supports broader leadership goals like **boundary spanning**. By using these techniques, leaders can better understand the unique values and expectations of members on other teams, which is the first step in **managing boundaries** and building psychological safety. Specialized research into **leader listening behaviors** continues to highlight how these skills help bridge the gap between different departments, ranks, and backgrounds.
