To put boundary-spanning leadership into action effectively, you must transform from a manager who "protects" boundaries to a leader who creates **direction, alignment, and commitment** across them. Because a massive gap exists between leaders who value this skill (86%) and those who feel effective at it (7%), a structured, tactical approach is necessary.

The sources outline a three-step universal strategy for putting boundary spanning into practice, which should be approached sequentially: **Manage boundaries, Forge common ground, and then Discover new frontiers**.

### **Step 1: Manage Boundaries (The Foundation)**
The first step is paradoxically to **strengthen or create boundaries** to establish a secure foundation. This clarifies how different groups will operate together and builds the **psychological safety** required for collaboration.

*   **Create a Boundary Spanning Team Charter:** Meet with partner teams to explicitly define shared purposes, roles, and responsibilities across the partnership.
*   **Job Shadowing:** Allow members from different teams to shadow one another for half-day sessions to learn about different values and assumptions.
*   **Adopt their Perspective:** Before making decisions, ask the team, "How would our partner team think about this?" to actively practice empathy and perspective-taking.

### **Step 2: Forge Common Ground**
Once the foundation of safety is set, leaders must prioritize **cultivating and nurturing personal relationships** to build trust and enable candid communication.

*   **Make Time for Personal Updates:** When meeting with collaborators outside your team, include time for personal updates to deepen the relationship.
*   **Establish Collective Symbols:** Create shared organizational symbols, names, or iconography that represent the combined "team-of-teams" rather than individual silos.
*   **Revisit Performance Metrics:** Identify and replace performance targets that reinforce silos or encourage competition between groups with **collaborative performance standards**.

### **Step 3: Discover New Frontiers**
This final stage involves **combining the unique capabilities** of your team with others to drive breakthrough innovation and transformation.

*   **Cross-Sector Partnerships:** Join your team with an organization from a completely different sector (such as a nonprofit) to tackle a shared challenge from a new angle.
*   **Small-Scale Projects:** Implement "small-scale, low-risk" cross-boundary projects to gain experience in collaboration without high stakes.
*   **Remove Impediments:** Target and reinvent existing boundaries that serve no purpose other than to impede current collaboration efforts.

### **Essential Groundwork for Success**
The sources emphasize that effective boundary spanning cannot happen in a vacuum; it requires **internal team health** first. 
*   **Internal Processes:** Before looking outward, ensure your own team has clear roles, defined priorities, and a culture of **trust**. 
*   **Trust as a Catalyst:** As noted in our conversation history and the sources, trust reduces the need for "monitoring" and allows for the **vulnerability** required to share information across different functions or ranks.
*   **Focus on One Strategy:** CCL recommends focusing on just **one strategy at a time** (starting with managing boundaries) until improvement is seen before moving to the next area. Even small gains, such as maintaining just one or two additional connections outside your team, can lead to meaningful increases in perceived influence and leadership effectiveness.
